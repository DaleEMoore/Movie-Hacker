This game is meant to make you look like you're doing the type of unrealistic movie "hacking" that is done in movies
while you're either just messing with the program, or doing simple tasks in the terminal.

The program should be a working terminal that gives a burst of code, dramatic sounds, and unnecessary nonsense when the
user does anything, no matter how minor. The final program can be used to trick technologically-illiterate people into
thinking that that's what computing really looks like.

For another good reference on what I want to recreate, look at this article: http://hackaday.com/2013/03/28/top-10-hacking-failures-in-movies/
